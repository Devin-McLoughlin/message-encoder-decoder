# message-encoder-decoder
Simple text encoder/decoder using very basic C++. Made in April, 2019. 

Around this time I had just learned a few fundamentals to C++ and recently watched The Imitation Game. It is a film based on a true story 
about a man named Alan Turing who in WW2, along with a group of others, was tasked with trying to crack the famous German encryption 
device known as The Enigma machine. So "logically", after having watched that and having no prior knowledge of encryption/decryption 
practices at all, I set out on an all night coding spree out of which popped this fun, neat little project. It takes a 4-digit key and uses
it to scramble the users message, which can then only be unlocked with that specific 4-digit key again. Keep in mind this is obviously not
ment to be used professionaly, it was mearly a fun project of mine. Enjoy!
