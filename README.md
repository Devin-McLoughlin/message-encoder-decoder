# message-encoder-decoder
Simple text encoder/decoder using very basic C++. Made in April, 2019. 

Around this time I had just learned a few fundamentals to programming and had recently watched The Imitation Game. It is a film based on a true story about a man named Alan Turing who in WW2, along with a group of others, was tasked with trying to crack the famous German encryption device known as The Enigma machine. After having watched it I set out on an all night coding spree, out of which came this code. It takes a 4-digit key and uses it to scramble the users message, which can then only be unlocked with that specific 4-digit key again. Keep in mind this is was not ment to be serious, it was mearly a fun project of mine. Enjoy!
